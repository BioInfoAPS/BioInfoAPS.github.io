### (Optional) Figtree for tree visualization
We will generate a tree in Newick format. 
You can download a tree viewing software such as 
[Figtree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) to visualize the tree.
Figtree is available for download for Windows, MacOS and Linux from 
its [github repository](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases).
