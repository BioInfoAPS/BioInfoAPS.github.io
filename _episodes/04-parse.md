## File parsing

In a bioinformatics project, it is common to use several programs in series
i.e. output of a program is used as input to another program. 
There are many standard data formats such as FASTA and BAM which are 
commonly accepted by most programs. 
This makes transition from one program to another program easier.
Unfortunately, sometimes programs output non-standard or 
proprietary formats, causing disconnect in using downstream programs. 
This is where file parsing is important. 
File parsing simply means reading the file and facilitating the data 
transformation for subsequent analysis.

Note: While file parsing does not sound important, a bioinformatician has 
to spend significant time correcting file formats.

## Running BLASTn for phytogenetic tree

In next lesson, we will phylogenetically compare ‘avrBs2’ gene 
from various strains of *Xanthomonas* species.
The ouline of activity will be as follows:

BLAST &rarr; parse to fasta format &rarr; align sequence &rarr; phylogenetic analysis
 
To get started, we will run BLASTn in SLURM just like last section, 
however, we will work with a larger set (20) of *Xanthomonas* genomes.
You can find the genomes in the directory 
`/blue/general_workshop/share/phylogeny`. 

~~~
$ cd /blue/general_workshop/<username>

$ cp -r ../share/phylogeny ./

$ cd phylogeny

$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
avrBs2.fas     GEV1063.fasta     GEV915.fasta     GEV993.fasta     Xp.fasta

  # Run blastn on that database

## BLAST XML output Vs FASTA format

Now, we can convert the BLAST `XML` output in a more common format
that can be read by multiple software to run analyses. 
Specifically, we will convert it to `FASTA` format, which we
will subsequently use to generate a phylogenetic tree.

BLAST XML format includes a lot of information on query and database name, 
sequence identity, statistics, alignments and so on.
Below, you can see what BLAST XML output looks like:

Note: The example below has been abridged.

~~~
$ cat Xeu_avrBs2.out
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE BlastOutput PUBLIC "-//NCBI//NCBI BlastOutput/EN" "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dtd/NCBI_BlastOutput.dtd">

{: .notes}

We will have to convert it into FASTA format which only needs two line from the XML:
`BlastOutput_db` and `Hsp_hseq`. The FASTA format looks like:

~~~

### Bash script to parse XML to FASTA

We will now use a bash script to parse the BLAST output to 
extract the file as a multiFASTA file.
THe script is located in path `/blue/general_workshop/share/scripts/blast2fasta.sh`

~~~
$ cp ../../share/scripts/blast2fasta.sh ./   

$ cat blast2fasta.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
#!/bin/bash
while read line
do
        [[ `grep "BlastOutput_db" <<< $line` ]] && echo -n ">" <<< $line
        [[ `grep -E "BlastOutput_db|Hsp_hseq" <<< $line` ]] && sed -n "s:.*>\(.*\)</.*:\1:p" <<< $line
done
~~~
{: .output}

What this script does is loop line by line (`while`) over the file, 
and look for (`grep`) keywords `BlastOutput_db` and `Hsp_hseq`.
If it find the keywords, then it will extract (`sed`) the contents
between those tags and output in appropriate format.

> We won't cover the exact syntax of the script. 
> This requires advanced knowledge of test command, ifelse shorthand, 
> extended posix and here string.
{: .tips}

### Running a bash script

We can call the bash script in two ways

- `./<script_name>`
- `sh <scriptname>`

~~~
$ cat *_avrBs2.out | ./blast2fasta.sh > avrBs2_all_genomes.fas
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The FASTA output is stored in file `avrBs2_all_genomes.fas`.

~~~
$ cat avrBs2_all_genomes.fas
~~~
{: .language-bash}

{: .tips}

Now we have a multiFASTA file with sequence id for each genome database 
we used along with their respective sequence. 
We can now use this FASTA formatted file to run sequence alignment and 
subsequently construct a tree.
