### Sujan Timilsina 

Sujan is a postdoctoral researcher in the Plant Pathology Department 
at the University of Florida. 
His interests are on population and molecular genomics, 
bacterial evolution and ecology, host-pathogen interactions and 
microbial ecology, and computational biology. 
His research is focused on understanding bacterial evolution and 
emerging pathogens and their impact in the disease epidemilogy. 
He is also interested in developing compuational methods 
for studying bacterial population.

### Erica M. Goss

Erica is an Associate Professor in the Plant Pathology Department 
at the University of FLorida. She studies the origins, evolution, 
population structure, and migration of plant pathogens. 
She is also interested in microbial ecology and the molecular evoution 
of virulence and host range as relates to the emergence of new pathogens.
