# Values for this workshop.
#------------------------------------------------------------

# More detailed instructions are available at:
# https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/customization/index.html

# Which carpentry is this ("swc", "dc", "lc", or "cp")?
# swc: Software Carpentry
#  dc: Data Carpentry
#  lc: Library Carpentry
#  cp: Carpentries (to use for instructor training for instance)
# Note that for regular workshops, you should use:
#  https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template
# and for instructor training events you should use:
#  https://github.com/carpentries/training-template
carpentry: "dc"

# This option is currently only needed for
# Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry workshops.
# The value of the variable will be ignored for Library Carpentry
# workshops.
# Possible values are:
# dc-ecology: for Data Carpentry Ecology workshops
# dc-genomics: for Data Carpentry Genomics
# dc-socsci: for Data Carpentry Social Sciences
# dc-geospatial: for Data Carpentry Geospatial
# swc-inflammation: for Software Carpentry based on the inflammation dataset
# swc-gapminder: for Software Carpentry based on the Gapminder dataset
curriculum: "dc-bioinformatics"

# If there is both an R and python official version of a curriculum
# (as listed on https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ and
# https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/), change the
# value of the variable below ("flavor") to get the schedule and installation
# instructions updated accordingly (valid values are 'r' or 'python').
# Note: this is only for Data Carpentry and SWC at this time.
flavor: "python"

# Overall title for the Workshop.
# This variable is used to (optionally) add a title in the "jumbotron"
# (the grey box at the top of the page), and to the extra pages.
# Most workshops don't use extra pages. More information about extra
# pages are included in the README:
# https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template#creating-extra-pages
title: "Basic	bioinformatics and command-line	tools	for	
phytopathologists"
